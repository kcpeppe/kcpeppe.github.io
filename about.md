I have been performance tuning Java applications for more than 20 years. I got started working along side [Jack Shirazi](https://jackshirazi.medium.com). Together we authored the first full workshop on Java Performance Tuning. I also helped Jack launch https://www.javaperformancetuning.com. Since then I have written many article and spoken at many conferences and user groups about performance tuning Java applications.

In 2006 I was named a Java Champion for my voice in the performance tuning space. In 2008 I created the first iteration of a Java performance tuning methodology (JPDM). In 2012, I helped found JClarity where we built a diagnostic tool that was based on the JPDM methodology.

In 2019, Microsoft acquired JClarity. I am currently employed as a Principal Engineer in the Java Engineering Group at Microsoft.
